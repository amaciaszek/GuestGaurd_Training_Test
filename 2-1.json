If you have a property, such as a cabin or one in the wilderness that is not meant to have WiFi, this won’t apply to you. \nThat’s why GuestGuard inspectors check WiFi connectivity speeds during inspections. \nThe minimum standard is 25 megabits per second — enough for streaming, work, and multiple devices. \nMake sure your WiFi is accessible, fast, and easy to connect to. Understanding that some properties, especially those in rural or rustic areas, don’t have WiFi, we at GuestGuard want to make sure that if the property is meant to have WiFi, it’s working as advertised for guests."
