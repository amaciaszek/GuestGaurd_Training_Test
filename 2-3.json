So, what’s unacceptable? \nExamples include loud ambient noise in your area and outside your home (such as construction, outside parties, traffic, et cetera), or constant disturbances like heavy machinery running nearby. We aren’t trying to punish hosts for living in a louder noise environment – we test for ambient noise levels so guests know what to expect before they book their stay. \nIt’s also important to make your guests aware of their own noise levels. This will ensure a peaceful, enjoyable experience for everyone on the property including the host, guests from other parties, and neighbors.",
