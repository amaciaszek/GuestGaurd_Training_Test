      "text": "[What Hazards Are & How to Identify Them]\nSo, what exactly are these hazards? Lead paint is old paint that contains lead, often found in homes built before 1978. It can be dangerous when it chips or creates dust. \nMold is a type of fungus that grows in damp areas, such as bathrooms, kitchens, or basements. It often appears as black or green patches on walls, ceilings, or tile grout — and it carries health risks for your guests. Foul odors may come from poor ventilation, smoke, or unclean surfaces. \nThese don’t just affect safety — they immediately impact guest satisfaction.",
